ScreenCalm Browser Extension Privacy Policy
===========================================

ScreenCalm is committed to respecting your privacy.

This extension is designed with simplicity, safety, and your wellbeing in mind — especially for individuals with screen sensitivity. Your data should stay yours, and we take that seriously.

🛑 What ScreenCalm Does Not Do

  ❌ Does not collect any personal information
  ❌ Does not store any user data on external servers
  ❌ Does not track your browsing activity
  ❌ Does not use cookies or localStorage for analytics or tracking
  ❌ Does not sell or share your information with third parties

ScreenCalm operates entirely within your browser. All settings you configure (such as overlay height, color, or blur) are stored locally in your browser’s sync storage, and are never transmitted anywhere.

🔐 Security

ScreenCalm is open source. Anyone can inspect the code to verify how it works and confirm that it respects your privacy.

The source code is available here:

✅ Summary

ScreenCalm is built to help, not to harvest your data. You don’t need to create an account. We don’t track you. Your experience with the extension stays private, by design.
